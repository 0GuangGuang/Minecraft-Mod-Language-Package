The Crafting Table is an exception for this, only a \u0026lCrafting Interface\u0026r is required to craft with this. The \u0026lCrafting Interface\u0026r will track changes in the storage network, and it will only mark the crafting job as completed once the expected outputs are present in the storage network.
