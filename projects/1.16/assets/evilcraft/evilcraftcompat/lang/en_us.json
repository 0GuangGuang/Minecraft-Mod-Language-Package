  "info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.blood_magic.text": "One day I discovered a very strange \u00261Blood Orb\u00260 that must have been owned by some kind of \u00261Magician\u00260. When using it I felt like I was somehow connected to it. After a while I discovered that it was in fact connected to my \u00264Blood\u00260 stream. By forcing a large amount of \u00264Blood\u00260 through it using the \u00261Blood Infuser\u00260, I\u0027ve managed to create an item that is both connected to my \u00264Blood\u00260 stream and can be used as a simple container, allowing me to place it in my favorite machines and using it with my items.",

  "info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.ee3.text": "Magicians have discovered that almost all things in this world have some kind of \u00261value\u00260 relative to other things. These people have mastered the act of \u00261transmuting\u00260 these things to each other. Their strange methods even seem to work with my items.",

  "info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.forestry.text": "When \u0026ovisiting\u0026r some of my friends working with trees and bees, I noticed that some of their bags allow me to insert some of my items. I also noticed that their machine called the \u00261Squeezer\u00260 is able to extract \u00264Blood\u00260 from parts of the \u00261Undead Tree\u00260, which can be easily grown using their tree growing system.",

  "info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.enderio.text": "These Ender-based technologies are very interesting, perhaps I could improve my machines based on that at some point. Eitherway, I seem to be able to process \u00261Dark Ore\u00260 and \u00261Dark Gems\u00260 using their machines, which is quite useful.",

  "info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.ic2.text": "There is a group of odd people who constantly work with buzzing machines. I have no idea what these machines do, except for the \u00261Macerator\u00260. I am able to insert \u00261Dark Ore\u00260 into it to immediately retrieve \u00261Dark Gems\u00260 and their crushed variant. Regular \u00261Dark Gems\u00260 can also be inserted to crush.",

It seems like we finally reached a stage where people have \u0022\u0026oJust Enough Items\u0026r\u0022, the knowledge from this book is understandable for them.",

  "info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.immersiveengineering.text": "I have to admit, the machines of those engineers look pretty neat. Other than that, they also appear to be very good in processing \u00261Dark Ore\u00260 and \u00261Dark Gems\u00260, but also in squeezing \u00261Undead Logs\u00260 and \u00261Undead Leaves\u00260 for \u00264Blood\u00260.",

I know only one thing about them, they have a machine that can transpose fluids which allows for some very basic blood infusion, but unfortunately this can\u0027t be upgraded.",

  "info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.thaumcraft.text": "I have noticed Thaumaturgy to be a very different kind of magic. It looks like Thaumaturges are very happy when they see items of mine, they always walk around here with their strange hexagons. To please my friends, I have constructed some \u00261Veined Scribing Tools\u00260 which can be used to write with \u00264Blood\u00260 instead of ink.",
