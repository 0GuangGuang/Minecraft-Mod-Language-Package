Oh, if i spill purifying fluid, Pyrofluid (yes, i call this - "Pyrofluid") freezes fluid faster!











The device will improve the first enchantment on the item. The order is the same as for the displayment of the enchantments in the item's description. Previously buffed enchantments will be skipped - the device is not quite powerfull enough to do thinks like Sharpness XI. It does not take the enchantment into account, so thinks like Silk Touch more are possible, yet useless. To infuse the item just put it in the only slot available and start the overchanting process by using your caster on the table. Then the Praecantatio essentia will be drawn from nearby jars into the table - you will need 32 Praecantatio in total. The table also requires a player nearby, since in the middle of the process it will use 30 levels from the player in range of 6 blocks!
Overchanting can be stopped in any time just by taking the item from the table, but the levels and the essentia will be wasted then. The table will draw Praecantatio from the range of 8 blocks, mirrors will also do the job just fine. Upon sapping experience the table will skip players with level before 30, so having multiple people with an overhaul level of 30 will not work. Any item with enchantments can be overchanted. Putting a not enchanted item in the Overchanting table does nothing.
