#From 1.12 onward, block and item names must be in lang files
#packaged within the jar.
#A copy is provided in millenaire/languages for the translators' convenience,
#but will not be used by Minecraft. It will however be copied within the jar
#when a new Mill√©naire version is packaged.


#The Translation Gaps calculator however does use the versions in the
#millenaire/language folder, so you can check your progress without
#copying it in the jar


#Item names




#The following items should not be translated
#They are either proper names (the deniers)
#or specific local specialities that aren't translated
#in other languages
#I'm putting them for non-Latin alphabet languages,
#so they can be written in other alphabets
