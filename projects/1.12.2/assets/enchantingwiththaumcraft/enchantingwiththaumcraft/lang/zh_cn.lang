enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.basic_ench.title=附魔书
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.basic_ench.text.stage.1=附魔台本身虽然很有用，但其过程却是随机的，而为了获取特定的附魔对大量物品进行附魔则是种令人厌烦的杂务。肯定有更加高效的办法来进行附魔。通常可用的附魔会根据放入附魔台物品的类型发生变化，但附魔台缺少进一步与材料组合的方法。也许注魔是解决问题的关键？
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.basic_ench.text.stage.2=我的理论是正确的，虽然和传统的附魔法有一些区别。最明显的区别是这种方法会吸收更多与附魔本身相关的材料，而这一特点的副作用则是移除了经验的需求，这实在令人庆幸。这种进程围绕两种特定物品展开：书和琥珀。在所有可附魔的材料中，书已经被证明是最佳的素材，能够获取任何所需的附魔。琥珀也同样重要，充当了附魔类别的转译物，让凡俗的材料也能够在附魔的选择中发挥作用。为此，我重建了大多数的基本附魔。

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.tool_ench.title=工具附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.tool_ench.text.stage.1=我目前还没能创建的工具附魔只剩下精准采集和时运。时运可能与某种宝石有关，但精准采集就显得棘手了。也许我偶然获得的稀土与其相关？
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.tool_ench.text.stage.2=成功了！时运和精准采集Success! Fortune and Silk Touch will make for excellent additions to my repertoire. Fortune can be created with Emerald, and Silk Touch requires rare earths, as I suspected, as well as a couple of slime balls, strangely enough.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.weapon_ench.title=基本武器附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.weapon_ench.text.stage.1=To begin my research into weapon enchantments, I've decided to look into Sharpness and Knockback. I see only one good candidate for Sharpness: quartz. And for Knockback, as silly as it may seem, pistons could be the answer.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.weapon_ench.text.stage.2=My hunches were right, though with one caveat. The higher levels of Sharpness also involve diamonds, in addition to quartz. Knockback can be created as expected, with pistons.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.spe_weapon_ench.title=特种武器附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.spe_weapon_ench.text.stage.1=Sharpness works for most purposes, but sometimes I'd prefer a more specialized enchantment, namely Smite or Bane of Arthropods. I wonder if Smite is related to glistering melons, parallel to the potion? Bane of Arthropods is likely unresponsive to normal spider eyes, but fermentation may change the story.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.spe_weapon_ench.text.stage.2=Looks like I was right, the process of fermentation on spider eyes seems to make them quite potent against their former owners. As for Smite, the lower levels can indeed be created with glistering melons, although the higher levels require an additional ingredient: silverwood saplings. Perhaps there is some truth to the "silver" in silverwood.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_weapon_ench.title=高级武器附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_weapon_ench.text.stage.1=The rare weapon enchantments, Fire Aspect, Looting, and Sweeping Edge, are all fairly simple concepts, but that also means a lot of potential candidates. Thankfully, the nature of alumentum means it should work as a catch-all material for Fire Aspect. As for Looting, gold seems to be the logical starting point. And for Sweeping Edge, I would prefer to use raw lightning but the destructive properties of TNT shall have to suffice.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_weapon_ench.text.stage.2=It turns out that gold was the key, but a lot more of it is involved in Looting than I expected. The alumentum also worked, although I had to supplement it with blaze rods to finalize the process. As for Sweeping Edge, it seems the TNT was a bit overkill and the lower levels can be created with gunpowder alone.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.bow_ench.title=基本的弓附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.bow_ench.text.stage.1=For bow enchantments, I shall begin with Power and Punch. Ender pearls are likely involved in Punch, as they are easily thrown and do cause movement, albeit strangely. My initial thoughts regarding Power turned towards gems of some sort, but I believe I will need a less rigid substance. I've yet to find many uses for quicksilver, perhaps it has some hidden properties?
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.bow_ench.text.stage.2=Not only were my guesses correct, but these ingredients appear to be the only two items related to the enchantments. Power can be created with increasing amounts of quicksilver; Punch is likewise with ender pearls.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_bow_ench.title=高级的弓附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_bow_ench.text.stage.1=I believe the Flame enchantment can be easily recreated with the help of alumentum, given its nature as a long-lasting fuel. However, infinity is quite a strange enchantment, seemingly defying the natural laws of the world. Regardless, I believe ender eyes might be connected, seeing as when they are released into the air they are drawn towards some foreign source of energy.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_bow_ench.text.stage.2=Success! The Flame enchantment was indeed related to alumentum, though the final recipe requires a couple extra clumps of blaze powder. Infinity can also be recreated with ender eyes, though it requires more than I expected.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.armor_ench.title=基本盔甲附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.armor_ench.text.stage.1=Now that I've figured out how Protection works, the remaining protection-based enchantments shouldn't be too much of a problem. I believe I have the keys to recreating these enchantments, though the higher levels may require more powerful ingredients.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.armor_ench.text.stage.2=Blast Protection is created with slime balls, but the higher levels require the most blast-resistant material I could find: obsidian. As for Projectile Protection, it is created with enchanted fabric and supplemented with slime blocks for the more powerful versions. Lastly, Fire Protection requires the use of magma cream, which is strangely cool to the touch, as well as ice for the higher levels, although it may be a problem getting a chunk of ice onto a pedestal.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_armor_ench.title=高级盔甲附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_armor_ench.text.stage.1=To finish up my collection of the standard armor enchantments, all that's needed is Thorns and Feather Falling. Thankfully, both of these enchantments seem to be obviously related to common materials.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_armor_ench.text.stage.2=As I thought, Thorns can be created with the use of cactus and Feather Falling with, well, feathers. What's more is that no additional ingredients are required.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.aquatic_ench.title=水生盔甲附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.aquatic_ench.text.stage.1=I've decided to dedicate the water-based enchantments to their own section, as they are all probably related to materials of similar origin. Looks like I'll need to fish up some volunteers for my research.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.aquatic_ench.text.stage.2=Further examination of these fish have revealed some interesting properties. Clownfish seem to be particularly intelligent, which makes them perfect for Aqua Affinity. Pufferfish are able to hold the largest amount of air, linking them to Respiration. Lastly, Salmon are able to attain the highest speeds, making them the choice for Depth Strider. Unfortunately, cod did not turn out to have any exceptional properties, though I admit they do make for a tasty meal.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.rod_ench.title=钓鱼竿附魔
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.rod_ench.text.stage.1=Sometimes a thaumaturge just wants to relax, and what better activity than fishing? However, as relaxing as it may be, I can't help but feel I could be relaxing more efficiently. On that thought, I've begun my research into the fishing rod enchantments, namely Lure and Luck of The Sea. Both could be related to a gem of some sort, but that is likely too complicated for a simple fishing enchantment. For Lure, I shall simply look into seeds, and for Luck of The Sea, gold nuggets.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.rod_ench.text.stage.2=Lure was indeed related to seeds, though the higher levels will require increasing varieties. Luck of The Sea was also related to gold, but it requires ingots rather than nuggets. The recreation of these enchantments should greatly increase the efficiency of my relaxation.
