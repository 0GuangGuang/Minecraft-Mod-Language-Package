#   Hello, and thanks for looking at the lang! If you are here to
#   translate it there are little tidbits above each section to
#   reference, but it's VERY straightforward. To translate the mod
#   desire! It's that simple!
#

#Items
#
#   item stands for "it is an item", just like in item.PC.name.
#   The middle one stands for its name as defined by code.
#	name defines the display name of the item
#	tooltip defines the tooltip text. If an item doesn't have value here, it won't have a tooltip.

#Attacks and their Descriptions
#
#   The ones with "attack.attackName.name" are the attacks' actual names and
#   the ones with "description" at the end are their descriptions.

# Max Moves



# G-Max Moves



#Pokémon and their descriptions
#
#   The ones with "name" at the end are their names and the ones with "description"
#   are their Pokédex entry descriptions.

#GUI stuff
#
#   The first part of it shows it's a GUI, e.g., "gui.guiEvolve.huh".
#   The second part shows where it goes to, e.g.,
#   "guiEvolve" goes to the evolve GUI and "guiItemDrops" goes to
#   the boss drop and Trainer drop GUIs.
#   The last part refers simply to its meaning in the GUI.
#   E.g., "gui.trading.trade" has "trade" at the end because
#   the text it displays would be trade. It isn't always like that.
#   For instance "gui.guiEvolve.done" doesn't say done; it says
#   "Your $p evolved into a $n"
#
#
#   In here you will notice some symbols like $p and $n.
#   "$p" refers to your Pokémon or a Pokémon in general when
#   there is only one being referenced in that line.
#   "$n" is the other Pokémon.
#   "$d" is the other player.
#   "$a" was a one time occurrence which stands for enabled or disabled
#   depending on what instance to call on.

#  Main Chat Messages
#
#   Here things are a bit different than the GUI stuff.
#   For anything that is a string and a variable like a Pokémon name, put "%s", which stands for a string.
#   If you are referencing an integer (whole number), use "%d".
#   E.g., "The wild %s escaped!". Let's say the Pokémon that escaped is Rattata. It will display in game
#   "The wild Rattata escaped!". Or on the rare occasion you come across an int,
#   E.g., "You got rid of %d items",
#   the previous "$p" and "$m" what have you do not apply here!
#






















# Blocks
#
#   Pretty much same basic concept here. Middle one represents
#   the item's blockName as defined and the first one "tile"
#   shows it's referring to a block type. "Name" is just
#   standing for its name.
#

















# Add key names from options menu



#Unown blocks


#
# Pixelmon config settings.
# keys that end with .comment are the config file's comments and are used as the tooltips in the GUI.
# keys that end with just the node are for the in-game GUI name.
# Keys that end with .tooltip are category's tooltips used in-game instead of the .comment's
