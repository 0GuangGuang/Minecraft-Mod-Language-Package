# Notes for translators.

# Thank you for considering localising Armourer's Workshop.
# Before you start consider getting the newest localisation file from GitHub development branch.

# This file will often have localisations for the next version of the mod.
#
# When the localisation file is done send it to me in whatever way you feel comfortable with.
