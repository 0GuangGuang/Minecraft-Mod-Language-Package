##OLD TEXT: The resin from a Dragon's Blood Tree was of particular interest to you, in hopes of making a golem aligned with the occult. <BR>However, what you created was a messy golem that falls apart rather easily. It also somewhat resembles human flesh, and it repulses you as a result. <BR>You are confident you will find a better material to fit this role.
